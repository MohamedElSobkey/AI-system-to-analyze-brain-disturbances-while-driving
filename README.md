# AI-system-to-analyze-brain-disturbances-while-driving

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system to analyze brain disturbances while driving. The system utilizes brainwave data (EEG), eye tracking, and motor imagery to detect disturbances that may affect driving performance. The goal is to create a tool that can potentially help reduce accidents caused by cognitive impairments while driving by providing real-time alerts to the driver or related systems.

## Features:
- Real-time EEG data processing for brainwave analysis.
- Detection of brain disturbances and their impact on driving behavior.
- Integration of motor imagery and eye tracking for enhanced disturbance detection.
- Predictive model using machine learning algorithms for accurate analysis.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for development.
- **EEG Data**: Used to analyze brainwave patterns and detect disturbances.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented using algorithms such as `XGBoost` to create predictive models.
- **Eye Tracking & Motor Imagery**: Additional data sources integrated for improved accuracy in detecting disturbances.
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and other essential libraries for data processing, visualization, and model training.
